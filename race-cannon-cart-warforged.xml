		<description>
			<p>The warforged were built to fight in the Last War. While the first warforged were mindless automatons, House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced sapient soldiers, giving rise to what some have only grudgingly accepted as a new species. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killer, or a visionary in search of meaning.</p>
			<h4>LIVING STEEL AND STONE</h4>
			<p>Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. Warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed.</p>
			<p class="indent">Although they were manufactured, warforged are living humanoids. Resting, healing magic, and the Medicine skill all provide the same benefits to warforged that they do to other humanoids.</p>
			<h4>WARFORGED PERSONALITY</h4>
			<p>The warforged were built to serve and to fight. For most of their existence, warforged had a clearly defined function and were encouraged to focus purely on that role. The Treaty of Thronehold gave them freedom, but many still struggle both to find a place in the post-war world and to relate to the creatures who created them.</p>
			<p class="indent">The typical warforged shows little emotion. Many warforged embrace a concrete purpose-such as protecting allies, completing a contract, or exploring a land-and embrace this task as they once did war. However, there are warforged who delight in exploring their feelings, their freedom, and their relationships with others. Most warforged have no interest in religion, but some embrace faith and mysticism, seeking higher purpose and deeper meaning.</p>
			<p class="indent">The typical warforged has a sexless body shape. Some warforged ignore the concept of gender entirely, while others adopt a gender identity.</p>
			<p class="indent">The more a warforged develops its individuality, the more likely it is to modify its body, seeking out an artificer to customize the look of its face, limbs, and plating.</p>
			<p class="indent"></p>
			<h4>WARFORGED TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your cannon cart character has the following traits. A few of the traits give you a choice; consider how your choice reflects the purpose for which your character was built.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> You are a mystery to what age you may be, and are immune to magical aging effects.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Most warforged take comfort in order and discipline, tending toward law and neutrality. But some have absorbed the morality, or lack thereof, of the beings with which they served.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p style="margin-left:10px;padding-bottom:10px;">Height is 4-5ft. tall<br/>Weight is between 250-300 pounds</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base rolling speed is 20ft. However, when rolling downhill you can roll at a speed of 40ft.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Constructed Resilience.</em></strong> You were created to have remarkable fortitude, represented by the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.</li>
				<li>You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.</li>
				<li>You are immune to disease.</li>
				<li>You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep.</li>
				<li>You have darkvision up to 60ft.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentry's Rest.</em></strong> When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn't render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Integrated Protection.</em></strong> Your body has built-in defensive layers, which can be enhanced with armor:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.</li>
				<li>You can don only armor with which you have proficiency. To don armor, you must incorporate it into your body over the course of 1 hour, during which you remain in contact with the armor. To doff armor, you must spend 1 hour removing it. You can rest while donning or doffing armor in this way.</li>
				<li>While you live, your armor can't be removed from your body against your will.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Specialized Design.</em></strong> You gain one skill proficiency and one tool proficiency of your choice.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak and read Common and one other language of your choice.</p>
			<h4>SPECIAL TRAITS</h4>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cannonball Recharge.</em></strong> You have 12 cannonballs. Used cannonballs recharge when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Engine.</em></strong> When you fully die, your engine explodes, dealing 3d6 fire damage. This increases to 3d8 at 6th level, 3d10 at 11th level, and 3d12 at 16th level. You can still be repaired, however you would no longer have a soul. You can however, be revived through magic to restore the soul before being repaired in order to maintain your soul. Magic that attempts to raise the dead cannot work.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Repairable.</em></strong> A DC 10 tinker's tools check restores 1 hit point for each point rolled over the DC. You cannot be healed by healing magic unless it is produced by a celestial or yourself.</p>
			<h4>ACTIONS</h4>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Actions.</em></strong> You cannot wield a weapon as a cannon cart, as you have no limbs. Therefore, you obtain your own special set of attacks.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Rolling Charge.</em></strong> If you roll at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a slam attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 bludgeoning damage. This increases by 1d6 every other level. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your strength modifier + your proficiency bonus or be knocked prone.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Slam.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack: </em>proficiency bonus + strength modifier, one target. <em>Hit: </em>1d6 + strength modifier bludgeoning damage. This increases to 1d8 at 6th level, 1d10 at 11th level, and 1d12 at 16th level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cannon (Recharge 3-6).</em></strong> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack: </em>proficiency bonus + dexterity modifier to hit, range 200/600 ft., one target. Refer to the chart below for the damage dice on level.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>4d4 at level 1-4</li>
				<li>4d6 at level 5-8</li>
				<li>6d6 at level 9-12</li>
				<li>6d8 at level 13-16</li>
				<li>8d8 at level 17-20</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>CLASS CHOICE</h4>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Class Choice.</em></strong> Your class choice has to work around the limitations of you as a cannon cart. You cannot be a monk or classes that involve punching. You cannot be an artificer, due to the fact that you are your own cannon and cannot craft things. You cannot be a blood hunter as you have no blood. You cannot be a sorcerer as you cannot have magic passed through to you. You are able to cast spells, requiring no somatic component as you have no hands. </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Barbarian.</em></strong> Your soul gets filled with rage using the barbarian class. Your slam will count as your proficient weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bard.</em></strong> Bards are a strange class for cannon carts, however not impossible. Instruments are built into you, which you can play with clockwork and your arcane engine.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cleric.</em></strong> Clerics being divine warriors, cannon carts have a hard time defining divination. That doesn't mean they can't obtain their powers from another source however.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Druid.</em></strong> Druids are interesting, being one with nature. Although you don't have hands, you still love the beautiful sights of nature.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Fighter.</em></strong> Fighters are very versatile, however some fighting styles are not available to you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Paladin.</em></strong> Paladins are confusing, very much so for cannon carts. Accepting their contracts usually comes from ancient origin, and usually don't present themselves until they are awakened again.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ranger.</em></strong> Rangers have many abilities that the cannon cart can and can't use. Anything related to smell or taste cannot be used.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Rogue.</em></strong> Rogues are very versatile for cannon carts. Stealth isn't the easiest thing for a machine of this stature, but it's doable.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Warlock.</em></strong> Few patrons have intrigue in these sentient machines, but when one does attach they love it. Cannon carts make great warlocks, just remember that they cannot smell or taste.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Wizard.</em></strong> Wizards are the most elegant cannon carts. They have the most intelligence poured into them and have the most knowledge transferred to them.</p>
