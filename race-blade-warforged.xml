		<description>
			<p>The warforged were built to fight in the Last War. While the first warforged were mindless automatons, House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced sapient soldiers, giving rise to what some have only grudgingly accepted as a new species. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killer, or a visionary in search of meaning.</p>
			<h4>LIVING STEEL AND STONE</h4>
			<p>Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. Warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed.</p>
			<p class="indent">Although they were manufactured, warforged are living humanoids. Resting, healing magic, and the Medicine skill all provide the same benefits to warforged that they do to other humanoids.</p>
			<h4>WARFORGED PERSONALITY</h4>
			<p>The warforged were built to serve and to fight. For most of their existence, warforged had a clearly defined function and were encouraged to focus purely on that role. The Treaty of Thronehold gave them freedom, but many still struggle both to find a place in the post-war world and to relate to the creatures who created them.</p>
			<p class="indent">The typical warforged shows little emotion. Many warforged embrace a concrete purpose-such as protecting allies, completing a contract, or exploring a land-and embrace this task as they once did war. However, there are warforged who delight in exploring their feelings, their freedom, and their relationships with others. Most warforged have no interest in religion, but some embrace faith and mysticism, seeking higher purpose and deeper meaning.</p>
			<p class="indent">The more a warforged develops its individuality, the more likely it is to modify its body, seeking out an artificer to customize the look of its face, limbs, and plating.</p>

			<h4>WARFORGED TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your cannon cart character has the following traits. A few of the traits give you a choice; consider how your choice reflects the purpose for which your character was built.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> You are a mystery to what age you may be, and are immune to magical aging effects.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Most warforged take comfort in order and discipline, tending toward law and neutrality. But some have absorbed the morality, or lack thereof, of the beings with which they served.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is either small or medium.</p>
			<p style="margin-left:10px;padding-bottom:10px;">Height is variable based on weapon<br/>Weight is between 4-20 pounds typically</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base floating speed is 30ft.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Constructed Resilience.</em></strong> You were created to have remarkable fortitude, represented by the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.</li>
				<li>You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.</li>
				<li>You are immune to disease.</li>
				<li>You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep.</li>
				<li>You have darkvision up to 60ft.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentry's Rest.</em></strong> When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn't render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Integrated Protection.</em></strong> Your body has built-in defensive layers, which can be enhanced with armor:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.</li>
				<li>You can don only armor with which you have proficiency. To don armor, you must incorporate it into your body over the course of 1 hour, during which you remain in contact with the armor. To doff armor, you must spend 1 hour removing it. You can rest while donning or doffing armor in this way.</li>
				<li>While you live, your armor can't be removed from your body against your will.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Specialized Design.</em></strong> You gain one skill proficiency and one tool proficiency of your choice.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak and read Common and one other language of your choice.</p>
			<h4>SPECIAL TRAITS</h4>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Built in weapon.</em></strong> You are a weapon, meaning you deal damage to that equal of the weapon you have taken the shape of. This weapon cannot be range based.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Repairable.</em></strong> A DC 10 tinker's tools check restores 1 hit point for each point rolled over the DC. You cannot be healed by healing magic unless it is produced by a celestial or yourself.</p>
			<h4>CLASS CHOICE</h4>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Class Choice.</em></strong> Your class choice has to work around the limitations of you as a weapon. You cannot be a monk or classes that involve punching. You cannot be an artificer, due to the fact that you are your own weapon and cannot craft things. You cannot be a blood hunter as you have no blood. You cannot be a sorcerer as you cannot have magic passed through to you. You are able to cast spells, requiring no somatic component as you have no hands. </p>
